                I am a web developer with a rock-solid basis in computer engineering, and my field of expertise is in the creation of responsive, user-friendly websites. Utilizing the techniques of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and problem-solving, I introduce dynamic projects that are first of all easy to work with and then fast and modern in appearance.  
                A long time in the engineering sector has prompted me to see a different side of web development as I plan out quite a number of tasks based on systems thinking. I am excited to explore and work on creative ideas, technologies, and websites as well as to develop them with clean design and optimized functionality, which consequently leads to an impact.
